# Android Shopping Cart

### This application contains 2 different screens.

### The app has been created to be used in portrait mode.


## The first screen contains 7 buttons and a text input field:

The add item will take the string that the user input into the above field and add it to the cart.

The milk, cereal, cheese, bread, and banana buttons will add the respective item to the cart.

Everytime the user adds an item, a notification will appear at the bottom of the screen.
The user may only add up to 15 items to the cart, otherwise, they will be notified that the cart is full.

The show my list button will bring the user to the screen where the cart is shown, and also to edit the cart.


## The second screen contains 3 buttons, a text input field, and a text view:

The add more button will return the user to the previous screen to add more items.

The delete all button will clear the users cart.

The delete item button will remove the item associated with the index of the item the user input into the text field.
### *Please note that if the number input is greater than the upper integer limit, or if the box is left blank, the app will crash if the roll button is pressed.*

The text view, located in the center of the screen, will show the user each of the items in the cart following an index.
